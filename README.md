This repository has been built and is being updated only to show the average of developers net income in some countries and the cost of living in that country.
### Tips:
1. All amounts are in the currency code of the country.
2. All amounts are in the year!
3. The cost of living is calculated for a married person without children.
4. You can help me to add or update this list ::)
